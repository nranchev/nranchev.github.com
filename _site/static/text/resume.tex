% General description:
% I think the magic number is 2 pages and at least your last 3 jobs (if applicable).
% This should make your resume interesting enough while still showing the recruiter
% you mean business and get to the point. If it's applicable you can swap the
% first and the last section. Any impressive certificates and achievements
% might also be listed in the education section (don't feel the need to include 
% everything, this is not a Christmas Tree).
% Good Luck!
