<p>
Programmers need something better than office! Who hasn't spent countless hours fiddling around with office to get the needed formatting. LaTeX is a painless way of achieving the same results without the headaches.
</p>

<h2>My Experience</h2> 
<p>
In the beginning there was darkness, dealing with assignments was formless and empty! And our professor said let there be LaTeX and there was LaTeX. We were forced to submit assignments in LaTex. I saw that LaTeX was good and soon I was using it for anything from math to my resume, and even faxing. As some might even say - "reduction of headaches at biblical proportions".
</p>

<h2>The Resume</h2> 
<p>
Collaboration at school was amazing with LaTeX. We would pass around the .tex files and update them - no formatting ambiguities during collaboration. When completed just render a PDF from them and life is good. Papers would always come out looking really good.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately in the non-academic world the only association made with the word "latex" is not that of a document markup language. So I would submit a PDF of my nicely formatted LaTeX resume and would get a response (often from an agency) "Please, submit a .doc version of your resume!". So I did! I am just kidding! Of course didn't! I don't have the bloody tools to produce the damn "MS word doc" files.

<h2>My Samples</h2> 
<p>
Here are some samples:
<ul> 
	<li><a href="/static/text/resume.tex" title="4.5Kb">resume.tex</a> | <a href="/static/pdf/resume.pdf" title="32Kb">resume.pdf</a> - a generic resume (this is the format I use) </li> 
	<li><a href="/static/text/math.tex" title="5.1Kb">math.tex</a> | <a href="/static/pdf/math.pdf" title="62Kb">math.pdf</a> - a math assignment (an actual network flow theory assignment)</li> 
</ul>
