<h2>Vim</h2> 
<p>
When I was searching for a good editor I was looking for extreme flexibility and very customizable interface. Having complete control over all shortcuts is very useful, it allows you to completely eliminate the need for mouse. Vim also offers all the useful features you can think of and more. For example something as simple as text search is done much better than average (yes I have seen abominable search options in some editors/IDEs).
</p>

<p>
How about split screens or multiple copy/paste registers, vertical select? Sure you might see those in other editors but they are not as customizable and rarely could be used efficiently. Plug-in system and syntax highlighters for any text format are available. Of course you might have seen those in other editors but in vim they are incredibly detailed and flexible. I often hear people say that everything vim does can be done with other equally powerful editors. Even if that's true I would still argue that Vim does it better and more efficiently.
</p>

<h2>Personal Notes</h2> 
<p>
I have found that dark background themes drastically minimize stress on my eyes. Avoiding the use of mouse makes me way more productive as it keeps my hands on the keyboard at all times. Over time I have found that split screens work much better than tabs (you can see many different files at the same time). Picking an editor that can be used in non-graphical environments has proven to be useful, especially when all the functionality is still available even without GUI.
</p>

<h2>My Config</h2> 
<p>
My config for vim includes basic things like setting up some UI options, color theme, formating options, etc... Most of it is copied from other people's configs and over time whatever I found useful I kept.
