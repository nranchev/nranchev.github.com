<h2>Proof of Concept</h2> 
The main purpose of this website is to serve as a proof of concept (demo of some webfoo). Very often people would just start using a complex framework where one is not needed. In addition the mainstream technologies might include scripting languages which, even though are easy to grasp, suffer from other issues. Sharing data across multiple workers (on the same machine) requires additional services and technologies and are often excessive in resource usage. In contrast the general purpose compiled languages tends to suffer from over-engineering and often require complex methodologies to achieve simple things.
<br /> 
<br /> 
What if development is even easier/faster than with a scripting language while still gaining the benefits of the compiled languages. This site uses no framework while being only a few lines of easy to read, maintainable code. In addition a lot of errors get caught during compilation and the template files get verified during load. Did I mention that content is loaded in memory and can be reloaded on demand (or automatically). The whole site can be delivered as a single stand-alone executable about 3-5Mb, statically compiled! Of course performance is also outstanding. If you haven't yet figured out what technology I am using perhaps this site is not intended for you.

<h2>Compatibility</h2> 
The UI work I have done in this demo is not particularly multi-platform friendly. I find little pleasure in playing a detective and investigating which browser respects universally accepted specifications. On top of that I only run Chrome (and Firefox). What I am trying to suggest is that if this site doesn't appear to render properly, I have either made a bad UI decision or you should upgrade to a real browser (or upgrade to a real computer - no mobile support available at this time).
